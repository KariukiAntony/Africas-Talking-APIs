 # Africas Talking API's

Africa's Talking, a mobile solutions firm integrating reliable two-way SMS, voice, and USSD functionality across mobile providers in Africa.

In this code, we are going to use the USSD APIs to create a love calculator application. A user will enter the partners' names and, in return, will get the love percentage and some recommendations.
